When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
     when i want to share my project with someone else,or if i want to work from other 
     system.i can access my project on other system. also,remots can be a good way backing up
     my work.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
     manually pulling helps me update my local repository when i want. if it happens automatically then i would not be 
     able to determine , what code has been changed.
